Hey!
I made a dog care guide to take care of your dog and it has many good tips!
This is a Submission for 🐶 Woof YSWS for Hack Club project
It also has an interactive chat-bot like thing called **WoofGPT** which fetches->(just like my dog)  dog-related information from Wikipedia using JavaScript.

I used the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wikipedia API
*special thanks to my IT textbook ;)

Thank you for your time,

Here is a screenshot of the website aswell!
